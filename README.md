# Machine Learning Techniques with Hitters Dataset
 A technical repository demonstrating the implementation of various machine learning models using the Hitters dataset. Includes K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest, CART, Gradient Boosting (GBM), XGBoost, and LightGBM. Covers data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation metrics, and practical insights, providing a comprehensive guide to machine learning workflows.

## Results & Insights
Feature importance analysis revealed that career statistics (e.g., cumulative hits and runs) are highly predictive of a player's salary.
Regularization techniques (Ridge and Lasso) helped prevent overfitting and improved generalization.
Tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) outperformed simple linear models in terms of accuracy.
Hyperparameter tuning significantly enhanced model performance.
